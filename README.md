# QuantumToken: Strategic Resource Allocation Protocol

## Overview
QuantumToken is a smart contract built with Clarity 2.0, designed to manage and distribute tokens in a quantum-secured, milestone-based framework. The protocol enables the allocation and management of resources while offering features such as anomaly detection, milestone validation, and emergency override mechanisms. It ensures comprehensive oversight and control for administrators and stakeholders.

### Key Features:
- **Quantum-Secured Token Distribution:** Securely manage the distribution of tokens across multiple recipients.
- **Milestone-Based Verification:** Token allocations are verified and distributed in phases based on predefined milestones.
- **Arbitration & Anomaly Detection:** Provides mechanisms for handling disputes and detecting irregularities within the system.
- **Operational Control:** Full oversight of the protocol via supervisor approval, timeline adjustments, and capsule management.

## Features

- **Capsule Management:** Allows for the initialization, termination, and extension of quantum resource allocations (capsules).
- **Multi-Recipient Distribution:** Facilitates the distribution of tokens to multiple recipients in a manner that ensures fair and balanced resource allocation.
- **Protection & Arbitration:** Supports emergency activation, dispute resolution, and protection mechanisms for the protocol's integrity.
- **Operational Monitoring:** Tracks the activities of originators and recipients to ensure compliance and security.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you deploy and interact with the QuantumToken protocol.

### Prerequisites

- **Stacks CLI**: The protocol is deployed and interacts with the Stacks blockchain.
- **Stacks Wallet**: To manage your tokens and interact with the contract.
- **Clarity IDE**: An IDE compatible with Clarity for building and testing the contract.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<username>/QuantumToken-Strategic-Resource-Protocol.git
    cd QuantumToken-Strategic-Resource-Protocol
    ```

2. Install any dependencies required (if applicable).

3. Deploy the contract using the Stacks CLI:
    ```bash
    stacks-cli deploy contract quantum-token.clar
    ```

4. Once deployed, interact with the contract through the provided functions to initiate quantum capsule distribution or other administrative actions.

## Contract Functions

### 1. `initialize-capsule`
Initializes a new quantum capsule for a recipient with a specified quantum value and milestone references.

**Arguments:**
- `recipient (principal)`
- `quantum (uint)`
- `milestones (list 5 uint)`

### 2. `initialize-branched-capsule`
Distributes quantum resources to multiple recipients with a specified allocation for each recipient.

**Arguments:**
- `destinations (list 5 { recipient: principal, allocation: uint })`
- `quantum (uint)`

### 3. `validate-milestone`
Verifies a milestone's completion and distributes quantum resources accordingly.

**Arguments:**
- `capsule-id (uint)`

### 4. `reclaim-quantum`
Allows the protocol supervisor to reclaim quantum if the capsule has expired.

**Arguments:**
- `capsule-id (uint)`

### 5. `terminate-capsule`
Allows the originator of a capsule to terminate the capsule early.

**Arguments:**
- `capsule-id (uint)`

### 6. `extend-capsule-timeline`
Extends the termination block for an active capsule.

**Arguments:**
- `capsule-id (uint)`
- `extension-blocks (uint)`

### 7. `amplify-quantum`
Increases the quantum of an existing capsule.

**Arguments:**
- `capsule-id (uint)`
- `additional-quantum (uint)`

### 8. `assign-capsule-proxy`
Delegates capsule operations (terminate, extend, amplify) to a proxy with an expiration period.

**Arguments:**
- `capsule-id (uint)`
- `proxy (principal)`
- `permission-terminate (bool)`
- `permission-extend (bool)`
- `permission-amplify (bool)`
- `delegation-span (uint)`

## Deployment

Follow the instructions above to clone, install dependencies, and deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain.
